    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">NEITHER SPIDER NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES (“SUPPLIERS”) WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE, SYSTEM FAILURE, OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT SPIDER HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">IN NO EVENT WILL SPIDER OR SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO SPIDER IN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES, OR IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY SUCH PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, ONE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($100).</p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS OF THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS REFLECTED IN THE PRICING OFFERED BY SPIDER TO YOU AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THESE TERMS.</p>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10 mb-5">21. Third-Party Services</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">While using the Services, you may enable, use, or purchase services, products, software, embeds, or applications (like themes, plugins, blocks) provided or manufactured by a third party or yourself (“Third-Party Services”).</p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">If you use any Third-Party Services, you understand that:</p>
    <ul class="list-inside list-disc pl-2">
     <li class="leading-loose mb-2">Third-Party Services aren’t vetted, endorsed, or controlled by Automattic.</li>
     <li class="leading-loose mb-2">Any use of a Third-Party Service is at your own risk, and we won’t be responsible or liable to anyone for Third-Party Services.</li>
     <li class="leading-loose mb-2">Your use is solely between you and the respective third party (“Third Party”) and is governed by the Third Party’s terms and policies.</li>
     <li class="leading-loose mb-2">Some Third-Party Services may request or require access to your data — or to your visitors’ or customers’ data — through things like pixels or cookies. If you use the Third-Party Service or grant them access, the data will be handled in accordance with the Third Party’s privacy policy and practices, which you should carefully review before you use any Third-Party Services. Third-Party Services may not work appropriately with our Services and we may not be able to provide support for issues caused by any Third-Party Services.</li>
     <li class="leading-loose mb-2">If you have questions or concerns about how a Third-Party Service operates or need support, contact the Third Party directly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">In rare cases we may at our discretion, suspend, disable, or remove Third-Party Services from your account or website.</p>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10 mb-5">22. Termination</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">We may terminate your access to and use of the Services, at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice or liability to you, provided that if Spider freezes your account or cancels your Subscription and the termination is not due to your breach of these Terms, Spider will provide you a pro rata refund of pre-paid unused fees unless, in our reasonable estimation, we are not legally permitted to do so (in which case any refund rights are null and void).</p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">You may cease use of the Services at any time. If you are paying for a Subscription, you may terminate your Subscription through the process in Section 5.4. You may also cancel your Spider account at any time by sending an email to support@spider.com.</p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">Upon any termination, discontinuation, or cancellation of Services or your Spider account, the following provisions of these Terms will survive: Service Terms, Charges and Payment (to the extent you owe any fees at the time of termination); Confidentiality; provisions related to permissions to access User Content (to the extent applicable); Warranties and Disclaimers; Indemnity; Limitations of Liability; Termination; and the Miscellaneous provisions under Section 11. Furthermore, we may remove or delete your User Content within a reasonable period of time after the termination or cancellation of Services or your Spider account.</p>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10 mb-5">23. Trademark Guidelines</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">Spider’s Trademark Guidelines apply to any use by you of Spider’s Marks. If you or your Authorized Users use Spider’s Marks, you will comply with, and will ensure your Authorized Users comply with, Spider’s Trademark Guidelines, available at <a href="" class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-500">www.spider.com/using-the-spider-brand/</a>.</p>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10 mb-5">24. Community Reviews and Comments</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">Should you write any reviews or provide any public comments on Spider Community, you grant Spider a non-exclusive, royalty free, worldwide (except to the extent prohibited by applicable law), transferable license to use that content for any use reasonably related to Spider Community, and to permit others to do so.</p>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10 mb-5">25. Force Majeure</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">Spider will not be liable for, or be considered to be in breach of or default under these Terms on account of, any delay or failure to perform as required by these Terms as a result of any cause or condition beyond its reasonable control, so long as it uses commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove those causes of non-performance.</p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">If Spider believes in good faith that it is legally prohibited from providing you or your Authorized Users with the Services, we may freeze your account and/or cancel your subscription at Spider’s sole discretion.</p>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10 mb-5">26. Notices</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">Any notices or other communications provided by Spider under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given by Spider: (i) via e-mail; or (ii) by posting to the Site. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10 mb-5">27. Severability</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof and it is the intent and agreement of the parties that these Terms will be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent necessary to render it valid, legal, and enforceable while preserving its intent or, if such modification is not possible, by substituting another provision that is legal and enforceable and that achieves the same objective.</p>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10 mb-5">28. Groups</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">Certain features of the Services may allow you to participate in teams, groups or organizations (each a “Group”). In those situations, the administrator, owner, or equivalent of the Group (“Admin”) is responsible for the compliance of these Terms by each other member of the Group, payment of the Subscription Fee (if applicable), and all matters related to the Group. For clarity, each member of the Group is still responsible for their own compliance with these Terms.</p>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10 mb-5">29. Assignment</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">These Terms (and your access to any of the Services) are not assignable or transferable by you without our prior written consent. Any purported assignment in violation of this section is null and void.</p>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10 mb-5">30. Service Providers</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">For the avoidance of doubt, Spider may engage third parties as service providers to the Services (for example, as of the date of these Terms, Spider hosts the Services on Amazon Web Services).</p>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10 mb-5">31. No Partnership</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms, and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other party in any respect whatsoever.</p>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10 mb-5">32. Translation</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">These Terms were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into other languages, and in the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the English version, the English version will control.</p>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10 mb-5">33. Jurisdiction and Applicable Law</h4>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-loose">Except to the extent any applicable law provides otherwise, the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions and the application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, U.S.A. Nothing in this Agreement affects your rights as a consumer to rely on mandatory provisions in your country of residence.</p>
